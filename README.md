# Food Delivery App (Practice Project)

Small frontend practice project that lists restaurants in card layout. Built with plain React components and CSS for learning UI composition, responsive grid layout, and simple component styling.

## Features
- Responsive restaurant card grid
- Hover effects and simple card interactions
- Header navigation and footer
- Filter button UI (placeholder for interaction)

## Tech
- React (JSX modules)
- HTML, CSS (index.css)
- No opinionated bundler required — works with simple dev server or your preferred React toolchain

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Open the project:
   cd Food-Delivery-App

3. Serve the app:
- Option A — Open directly:
  - Open `index.html` in your browser (works for simple demos)
- Option B — Local dev server (recommended):
  - Use a static server like `live-server`, `http-server`, or your preferred bundler (Parcel/Vite/Create React App).
  - Example with npx http-server:
    npx http-server -c-1 .

4. If using a bundler, set entry to `index.html` and ensure JSX modules are handled by your tool.

## Project Structure
- index.html — entry HTML
- index.css — main styles
